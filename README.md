### Iris Multiclass Classification
This model uses the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of iris flowers to determine the species of each flower. 
This is an example of logistic regression being applied to a multiclass classification model, as there are 3 species total that the 
flowers can be categorized as (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). The accuracy score for this model is at 96%.

### Titanic Survival Binary Classification
This model uses various data about passengers on the Titanic to determine whether or not they survived. This is an example of 
logistic regression being applied to a binary class classification model, as there are only 2 possible outputs (1 for survived or 0 for did not survive). 
The accuracy score for this model is at 83%.

### Weight-Height Linear Regression
This model uses data about the weights and heights of various people and uses it to determine the linear relationship between these
two variables and predict future outcomes. This is an example of a linear regression model, as a linear relationship is being evaluated. 
The accuracy score for this model is at 85%.
